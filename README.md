#This circuit simulates a basic weather station using an Arduino Uno, a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, and an I2C-connected LCD screen. The DHT22 sensor is wired to digital pin 7 of the Arduino, and it continuously measures ambient humidity and temperature. These readings are processed by the Arduino and displayed on the LCD screen, which is initialized and controlled via the I2C protocol. The code includes error handling to detect failed sensor readings and updates the display every two seconds with the latest values. This setup is ideal for learning how to integrate sensors and output devices in Arduino projects, and it demonstrates real-time environmental monitoring in a compact and efficient design. It is designed in wokwi simultor.
